# Ethical Reflection: Bias-Aware AI Project

The Bias-Aware AI project provided a valuable opportunity to critically examine the ethical challenges that arise when deploying machine learning systems in high-stakes social contexts. By focusing on the COMPAS dataset—a real-world example of algorithmic decision-making in the criminal justice system—I gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities of fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI.

## Fairness and Bias

One of the most significant ethical concerns in this project was the presence of bias in risk assessment tools. The analysis revealed that, while some fairness metrics (such as disparate impact and equal opportunity difference) suggested equity between African-American and Caucasian groups, there were still notable disparities in error rates, particularly in false positive rates. This highlights that relying on a single fairness metric can be misleading, and a comprehensive evaluation must consider how errors are distributed among different groups. The potential for such tools to reinforce or exacerbate existing social inequalities underscores the importance of ongoing bias audits and the implementation of mitigation strategies.

## Transparency and Explainability

Another ethical dimension is the need for transparency and explainability in AI systems. Stakeholders—including defendants, judges, and the public—must be able to understand how risk scores are generated and what factors influence predictions. Black-box models that lack interpretability can erode trust and make it difficult to identify or correct unfair outcomes. This project reinforced the value of using open-source tools and clear documentation to support transparency.

## Accountability and Social Impact

The use of AI in sensitive domains like criminal justice raises questions about accountability. If an algorithm produces biased or erroneous predictions, who is responsible for the consequences? This project emphasized the need for human oversight, regular audits, and mechanisms for individuals to challenge or appeal algorithmic decisions. It also highlighted the broader social impact of AI: decisions made by these systems can affect lives, liberty, and public trust in institutions.

## Personal Takeaways

Through this project, I learned that ethical AI is not just a technical challenge but a social one. It requires collaboration between data scientists, domain experts, ethicists, and affected communities. Moving forward, I am committed to advocating for fairness, transparency, and accountability in all AI projects I participate in. Regular bias assessments, stakeholder engagement, and a willingness to question and improve existing systems are essential for building AI that serves
