# Bias-Aware-AI
PLP Week 7 project Bias Aware AI focuses on designing responsible and fair AI systems. It covers algorithmic bias, GDPR, and ethical principles. Using AI Fairness 360, we audit the COMPAS dataset for racial bias and propose solutions to improve fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI.
