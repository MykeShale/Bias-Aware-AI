PLP Week 7 – Bias Aware AI Project  


## 🧠 Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

**Definition:**  
Algorithmic bias occurs when an AI system produces systematically prejudiced or unfair results due to skewed data, flawed algorithms, or biased human input during design or training.

**Examples:**
1. ⚙️ A hiring algorithm trained on historical recruitment data may favor male candidates if the dataset reflects past gender bias in hiring, penalizing equally qualified women.
2. 📸 Facial recognition systems often misidentify individuals with darker skin tones at higher rates due to underrepresentation in training data, leading to higher false positives in minority populations.

## 🔍 Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

**Transparency** is the openness of an AI system’s architecture, data sources, and decision-making processes. It allows external stakeholders to inspect how the system was built and operates.

**Explainability** is the system’s ability to provide human-understandable reasons for its decisions or predictions.

**Why they matter:**
- Transparency enables auditing, accountability, and regulatory compliance.
- Explainability fosters trust and allows users to interpret or challenge automated decisions, especially in critical sectors like healthcare, law enforcement, or credit scoring.

Together, they promote responsible AI development and usage.

## 🇪🇺 Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?

GDPR enforces strict rules on how personal data is collected, stored, and used, directly impacting AI systems:

- 📝 Requires informed and explicit consent for data use, particularly in profiling or automated decision-making.
- 🧾 Grants users the "right to explanation," pushing developers toward interpretable AI models.
- ♻️ Imposes data minimization and limited retention policies, restricting the volume and duration of data available for training.
- 💶 Non-compliance results in heavy penalties, incentivizing privacy-by-design and ethics-first approaches in AI design.

GDPR drives AI toward fairness, privacy, and accountability.
