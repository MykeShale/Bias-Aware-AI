# Case Study 2: Facial Recognition in Policing

## Scenario
A facial recognition system misidentifies minorities at higher rates when used in policing.

## Tasks

### 1. Discuss ethical risks

1. Wrongful Arrests:
   - Higher misidentification rates for minorities could lead to unjust detentions or arrests, violating individual rights and freedom.

2. Privacy Violations:
   - Widespread use of facial recognition in public spaces may infringe on citizens' right to privacy and anonymity.

3. Reinforcement of Systemic Bias:
   - Overreliance on a biased system could exacerbate existing racial disparities in policing and the criminal justice system.

4. Erosion of Trust:
   - Misidentifications and privacy concerns could further damage the relationship between law enforcement and minority communities.

5. Chilling Effect on Free Speech:
   - Fear of surveillance might discourage participation in public gatherings or protests, impacting free speech and assembly rights.

### 2. Recommend policies for responsible deployment

1. Strict Accuracy Thresholds:
   - Establish minimum accuracy standards across all demographic groups before deployment.
   - Regularly audit and retrain systems to maintain or improve accuracy.

2. Human Oversight:
   - Require human verification of all AI-generated matches before any law enforcement action is taken.
   - Implement a "two-person rule" for confirming matches in critical situations.

3. Transparency and Accountability:
   - Maintain detailed logs of system usage, including operator, purpose, and outcome.
   - Allow for independent audits of the system's performance and impact.

4. Limited Use Cases:
   - Restrict facial recognition use to specific, high-priority crimes rather than routine policing.
   - Prohibit use for surveillance of protests or other constitutionally protected activities.

5. Data Protection and Consent:
   - Implement strict data retention and deletion policies.
   - Require informed consent for inclusion in facial recognition databases, except for convicted felons.

6. Diverse Development Teams:
   - Ensure diverse representation in teams developing and deploying these systems to address potential blind spots.

7. Public Engagement:
   - Conduct community consultations before deployment and provide clear opt-out mechanisms for citizens.

8. Continuous Education:
   - Provide ongoing training for law enforcement on the limitations and proper use of facial recognition technology.

9. Legal Recourse:
   - Establish clear procedures for individuals to challenge facial recognition identifications and seek redress for misidentifications.
